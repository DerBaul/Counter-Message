# Counter-Message
Is a Project I build to learn working with Front- and Backend.

The Site has a counter that will increase every time it gets clicked.
The counter's state is stored in the backend, and the next number shown is also calculated in the backend.
Users can add messages at a number that hasn't been shown yet. The message with its position will be stored using SQLite. 
Once the Counter reaches a position at which a message is stored, the message gets displayed. 
This allows users to place messages, that other users can discover.
